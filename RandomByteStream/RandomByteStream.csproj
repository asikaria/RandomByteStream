    <Description>
Generates random numbers for creating a high-performance test stream.

This stream pre-generates generates a few megabytes of random data, and uses that same data repeatedly. 

This is not suitable for security purposes. However, for testing data processing pipelines,
this provides just what is needed - random (non-compressible) bytes of arbitrary length, available at 
very high speed.
